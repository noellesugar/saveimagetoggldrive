# saveImagesAndWritePath function in Google Apps Script

The function `saveImagesAndWritePath` is used to fetch images from a URL and save them to Google Drive. Additionally, it also writes the paths of these images to the corresponding cells in a Google Sheet. 

## Variables
- `counter` is a variable that starts from 1 and is used to keep track of the number of images that have been processed.
- `sheet` is the active sheet of the Google Spreadsheet. 
- `lastRow` is the last row in the sheet that has data.
- `data` is a 2D array that contains the URLs of the images that need to be processed, obtained from the range "E2:E" + lastRow in the sheet.

## Loop
The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through the URLs stored in `data`. For each iteration:

- `url` is assigned the value of the URL at the current iteration.
- The code continues to the next iteration if `url` is falsy (i.e., if the URL is not present).

## Try-Catch Block
The code inside the `try` block attempts to fetch the image from the URL and save it to Google Drive.

- `response` is the response obtained from fetching the URL using `UrlFetchApp.fetch(url)`.
- `blob` is the binary data of the image obtained from `response.getBlob()`.
- `file` is the Google Drive file created using the binary data `blob` with `DriveApp.createFile(blob)`.

The following variables are defined to store the file ID, URL, and paths of the image in Google Drive and on a Mac:

- `fileId` is the ID of the file stored in `file` using `file.getId()`.
- `fileUrl` is the URL of the file stored in `file` using `file.getUrl()`.
- `googleDrivePath` is the path of the image in Google Drive and is generated using "/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My\ Drive/Images/" + counter + ".png".
- `macPath` is the path of the image on a Mac and is generated using "/Users/noelle/Desktop/Images1/" + counter + ".png".

The paths of the image are then written to the corresponding cells in the sheet using `sheet.getRange(i + 2, 6).setValue(googleDrivePath)` and `sheet.getRange(i + 2, 7).setValue(macPath)`.

The image is then copied to a folder in Google Drive with ID "1hSOSTi5DaSOf1GpWunINoDitJaH68MgJ" using `file.makeCopy(folder)`. The name of the copied file is set to the current value of `counter` plus ".png" using `newFile.setName(counter + ".png")`.

Finally, `counter` is incremented by 1 to keep track of the number of images processed.

The code inside the `catch` block is executed if an error occurs in the `try` block. The error message is written to the corresponding cells in the sheet using `sheet.getRange(i + 2, 6).setValue("Error: " + e.message)` and `sheet.getRange(i + 2, 7).setValue("Error: " + e.message)`.

# Function to Save Images and Write Path

The function `saveImagesAndWritePath` is a script for Google Apps Script that allows you to save images from a Google Sheet and write their path to the same sheet.

## Variables
1. `counter` - a variable that is initialized to 1 and is used as the counter for naming the images that are saved.
2. `sheet` - a variable that references the active sheet in the current Google Spreadsheet using the `SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet()` method.
3. `lastRow` - a variable that stores the last row number in the `sheet` using the `sheet.getLastRow()` method.
4. `data` - a two-dimensional array that stores the values of the specified range (from column E, row 2 to column E, `lastRow`) in the `sheet` using the `sheet.getRange("E2:E" + lastRow).getValues()` method.

## Loop to Process Each Image
The `for` loop iterates over the `data` array and processes each image.
1. `var url = data[i][0]` - a variable that stores the URL of the current image.
2. `if (!url) continue;` - an `if` statement that checks if the URL is empty. If it is, the loop continues to the next iteration.
3. `var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url);` - a variable that stores the HTTP response of fetching the image from the URL using the `UrlFetchApp.fetch(url)` method.
4. `var blob = response.getBlob();` - a variable that stores the binary large object (BLOB) representation of the image using the `response.getBlob()` method.
5. `var file = DriveApp.createFile(blob);` - a variable that stores a reference to the newly created file in Google Drive using the `DriveApp.createFile(blob)` method.
6. `var fileId = file.getId();` - a variable that stores the ID of the newly created file using the `file.getId()` method.
7. `var fileUrl = file.getUrl();` - a variable that stores the URL of the newly created file using the `file.getUrl()` method.
8. `var googleDrivePath = "/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My\ Drive/Images/" + counter + ".png";` - a variable that stores the path of the newly created file in Google Drive using the format `/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My\ Drive/Images/[counter].png`.
9. `var macPath = "/Users/noelle/Desktop/Images1/" + counter + ".png";` - a variable that stores the path of the newly created file on a Mac desktop using the format `/Users/noelle/Desktop/Images1/[counter].png`.
10. `sheet.getRange(i + 2, 6).setValue(googleDrivePath);` - sets the value of the cell in the `sheet` at row `i + 2` and column 6 to the value of `googleDrivePath`.
11. `sheet.getRange(i + 2, 7).setValue(macPath);` - sets the value of the cell in the `sheet` at row `i + 2` and column 7 to the value of `macPath`.
12. `var folder = DriveApp.getFolderById("1
12. `var folder = DriveApp.getFolderById("1hSOSTi5DaSOf1GpWunINoDitJaH68MgJ");`
   This line of code sets the variable `folder` to a Google Drive folder with the specific ID `"1hSOSTi5DaSOf1GpWunINoDitJaH68MgJ"`. 
13. `var newFile = file.makeCopy(folder);`
   This line creates a copy of the file that was previously created from the image and places it in the folder specified in the previous line. 
14. `newFile.setName(counter + ".png");`
   This line changes the name of the newly created file to be the value of the `counter` variable, which was previously incremented, followed by the extension `.png`.
15. `counter++;`
   This line increments the value of the `counter` variable by 1. 
16. `} catch (e) {`
   This line begins a catch block to handle any errors that may occur in the try block.
17. `sheet.getRange(i + 2, 6).setValue("Error: " + e.message);`
   If an error occurs in the try block, this line writes the error message to cell `(i + 2, 6)` of the active sheet.
18. `sheet.getRange(i + 2, 7).setValue("Error: " + e.message);`
   Similar to the previous line, this line writes the error message to cell `(i + 2, 7)` of the active sheet.
19. `}`
   This line closes the catch block.
20. `}`
   This line closes the for loop.
21. `}`
   This line closes the function definition.
